# DeckScrubber

DeckScrubber is a convenient and effective tool for managing Docker containers. The application is designed to streamline the process of controlling the lifecycle of containers, providing capabilities for launching, stopping, and removing Docker containers, as well as servicing related data.

Deck Scrubber consists of two parts: server and client.

- **The server part** is written in Node.js and is responsible for processing client requests, executing Docker commands, and returning results. It serves as a link between the user interface and the Docker service.

- **The client part** is created using Vue.js and represents a web interface that provides users with a graphical representation of containers and simplifies the process of managing them.
